***Idle Anime Downloader*** - Scrapes from *https://www12.9anime.to*

# 9anime_dl
- Supported Platforms: **Linux**

# Description
Because 9anime does NOT like it when people download their content using bots or whatever, they limit the bandwitch usage to about 1MB for downloads.  Other than the downloading process, which is slow as shit, it should take around a solid half a minute to get it going, that being said, typing in the anime that you want, selecting it, then specifying how many episodes you want.  After all of that, you just wait, and it will automatically write the videos into a dedicated folder.  Also, because the content isn't being stored into memory before writing, you should be able to watch it as it downloads, as long as you don't skip ahead to far.

# *Requirements*

`pip3 install requests bs4 lxml selenium`

- *Add [webdriver][1] to **PATH** under *System Variables* of *System Environmental Variables**
